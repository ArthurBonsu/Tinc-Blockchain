# Token Module Implementation Preparation

To build a token module that's fully compatible with your **Tinc Blockchain** architecture, I would need to understand the following files in depth:

---

## 🧠 Smart Contract System Files

- `core/smartcontract/Evm.java` — To understand how contracts execute  
- `core/smartcontract/SmartContractProcess.java` — For contract lifecycle management  
- `core/smartcontract/templates/ERC20TokenTemplate.java` — To see any existing token patterns  
- `core/smartcontract/ContractABI.java` — For interface definitions  
- `core/smartcontract/EventLog.java` — To understand event emission  

---

## 🗂️ State Management Files

- `core/state/StateManager.java` — To understand how state is updated  
- `core/state/StateDB.java` — For state persistence  
- `core/state/MerkleTrie.java` — To understand state structure  

---

## 🔁 Transaction and Block Processing

- `core/block/transaction/Transaction.java` — To understand transaction structure  
- `core/mempool/TransactionValidator.java` — For transaction validation rules  
- `core/block/BlockProcessor.java` — To understand how transactions are processed  

---

## 🔐 Wallet Integration

- `core/wallet/Wallet.java` — For standard wallet operations  
- `core/wallet/ContractWallet.java` — To understand contract interactions  
- `core/wallet/TransactionBuilder.java` — For creating transactions  

---

## ⚙️ Solidity/Contract Compilation

- `core/solidity/SolidityCompiler.java` — To understand contract compilation  
- `core/solidity/SolidityManager.java` — For contract management  

---

## 🧪 Any Existing Token Examples

- `core/smartcontract/templates/ERC20TokenTemplate.java` — For existing token patterns  

---

## 📊 Blockchain State Access

- `core/eth/Blockchain.java` — For blockchain interactions  
- `core/eth/BlockchainState.java` — For state access  

---

## ✅ Token Module Deliverables

After reviewing these files, I would be able to create a token module that includes:

- `core/token/TokenStandard.java` — Interface defining token standards  
- `core/token/TokenRegistry.java` — For managing deployed tokens  
- `core/token/TokenBalanceManager.java` — For specialized balance tracking  
- `core/token/TokenTransferProcessor.java` — For token transfer operations  
- `core/token/types/FungibleToken.java` — Implementation of fungible tokens  
- `core/token/types/NonFungibleToken.java` — Implementation of NFTs  
- `core/token/TokenEvents.java` — Token-specific events  
- `core/token/test/TokenTest.java` — For token-specific tests

Would you be able to provide the content of some of the key files listed above so I can better understand the implementation patterns in your project?
